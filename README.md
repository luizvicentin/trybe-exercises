This repository contains two folders, both created while studying at Trybe. The course-summaries folder contains home-made compiled lessons, so they can be consulted by peer students, whereas the exercises folder displays all the developed learning activities.

The Trybe program has more than 1,500 hours of classroom and online classes and covers front-end, back-end, computer science, software engineering, agile methodologies, and soft skills.
