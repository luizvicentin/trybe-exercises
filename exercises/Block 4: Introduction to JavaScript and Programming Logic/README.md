# Introduction to JavaScript and Programming Logic
<blockquote>“Do your best, but always on time!”</blockquote>

## What will we learn?

Here you will learn about the JavaScript programming language.

To do this, we divide the content into five parts:
1. First you will learn about variables , constants , primitive types , dynamic typing , arithmetic operators , 
   assignment operators , logical operators , if/else and switch/case :

2. This part presents arrays and for :

3. In the third part you will learn about programming logic and algorithms :

4. The fourth part deals with objects , for/in and functions :

5. Last but not least, let's go to the Playground Functions Project:
