# Introduction to JavaScript and Programming Logic

## What will we learn?

Here you will learn about the JavaScript programming language.

To do this, we divide the content into five parts:
1. First you will learn about variables , constants , primitive types , dynamic typing , arithmetic operators , 
   assignment operators , logical operators , if/else and switch/case :
    
    → First steps JavaScript

2. This part presents arrays and for :

    → Array and loop For JavaScript

3. In the third part you will learn about programming logic and algorithms :
    
    → Programming Logic and JavaScript Algorithms

4. The fourth part deals with objects , for/in and functions :
    
    → JavaScript objects and functions

5. Last but not least, let's go to the Playground Functions Project:
    
    → Playground functions
