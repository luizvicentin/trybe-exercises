# Introduction to JavaScript and Programming Logic
<blockquote>“Do your best, but always on time!”</blockquote>

## What will we learn?

Here you will learn about the JavaScript programming language.

To do this, we divide the content into five parts:
1. First you will learn about variables , constants , primitive types , dynamic typing , arithmetic operators , 
   assignment operators , logical operators , if/else and switch/case :
    
    → _[First steps JavaScript](https://github.com/luizvicentin/trybe-exercises/tree/master/exercises/Block%204:%20Introduction%20to%20JavaScript%20and%20Programming%20Logic/Day_01)

2. This part presents arrays and for :

    → _[Array and loop For JavaScript](https://github.com/luizvicentin/trybe-exercises/tree/master/exercises/Block%204:%20Introduction%20to%20JavaScript%20and%20Programming%20Logic/Day_02)

3. In the third part you will learn about programming logic and algorithms :
    
    → Programming Logic and JavaScript Algorithms

4. The fourth part deals with objects , for/in and functions :
    
    → JavaScript objects and functions

5. Last but not least, let's go to the Playground Functions Project:
    
    → Playground functions
