    <h1>Everything</h1>
    <h6>BY FANNY HOWE</h6>
    <p>
        Infinite nesting <br>
        pushes all matter <br>
        towards emptiness: <br>
        child-nodes, <br>
        tree-droppings <br>
        with a root element of null. <br>
        None is always included <br>
        in every cluster <br>
        of children. <br><br>
        
        Nothing in nothing <br>
        prepares us. <br><br>
        
        Yet a fresh light was shed <br>
        on immortality <br>
        for me climbing the stairs <br>
        firm foot first. <br><br>
        
        Everything was in the banister: <br>
        crows on branches, crickets, <br>
        architects, handsaws and democrats. <br>
        Red moon at 3 am.
